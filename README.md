# dYdX_LPRewardsOptimization


The current liquidity provider rewards formula includes a few different parameters for scoring providers on their quotes. This research will be exploring methods of optimizing these parameters to encourage better liquidity and improve the efficiency of the LP rewards program. The most significant update will be to the MaxSpread parameter, exploring competitive spreads across dYdX markets (currently set at 20bps for BTC and ETH, and 40bps on all others).
